### Signatures & Rosters

We first started by interviewing our partner athletic directors, we discovered that they would often have to pressure the staff into collecting parent signatures for any waivers or forms required by the school's conference. We also found that collecting signatures was the school's main way to update yearly roster changes. Entering player information manually from a pile of forms created extra work, and caused some of VNN's other products to be neglected. Our partner schools came to us trying to build a web presence, but now the additional problems they had were no longer being solved by the tools given to them.

### Requirements

Almost every school district had a different set requirements when registering students for programs/teams. I realized that although many of our partner schools asked for the same thing, our products needed to be somewhat configureable to meet all their needs. In order for this product to be successful, flexibility was needed for what documents/forms should be included, signed, and how payments were collected.

**Forms & Fees**

Talking to schools about their current method of assigning forms to programs and fee collection, revealed that they were all in on of two categories. Those that needed to be attached season wide, or those attached on a per program basis.

### Serving Schools & Communities.

VNN's Registration product served two types of users. Staff needing to manage their school's program documents, payments, and fees. And parents/guardians reviewing, paying, and signing up for the programs. Regulations set by our school's different conferences meant that our system needed to be functionally similar, yet flexible to meet the all the different needs.

### Visual Design
VNN's product suite design language had been been clearly defined before registration's development began. However this was one of the first projects I was able to contribute on as a designer, so I felt that even though visual design was a minor chore in the process, it was still an important lesson for me to understand where branding, development, and clear communication all met.

**Summary**

Before the initial release, we learned how to improve our payment management system. Some schools wanted to use the product as a free service to their communities and had no need to monetize the process. After completion, VNN's Registration product gave schools a convenient way to update team rosters to keep their content fresh and organized. The content being generated by registration also helped by laying groundwork for VNN's future line of product releases.
