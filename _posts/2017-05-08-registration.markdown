### Forms & Rosters

When we first started talking to our partner athletic directors, we discovered that they would often have to pressure their staff into collecting parent signatures on any waivers or forms required by the school's conference. Also, we found that collecting signatures was the staff's main way to update the yearly roster changes. Entering player information manually from a pile of forms created extra work for staff and caused some of VNN's programs to be neglected. Schools trying to build a web presence were not only trying to keep up with their normal demand, the underlying problems they had weren't being solved by the existing tools they had.

### Requirements

Saying that each school district had different requirements would be an understatement. I quickly realized while working at VNN that all of our products need some flexibility in at least one, or two areas. In order for this product to be successful we needed documents requiring signatures, and payments to be configureable.

**Collecting Information**

Getting the required basic information *e.g. emergency contacts, payment methods...*  from users was a pretty standard task. However the documents, once uploaded, needed to be attached on either a school wide or per program basis.
<br>
<br>

**Program Fees**

Adjusting and adding prices to the athletic programs needed to work in a similar fashion as attaching documents. About half our schools used a flat fee for all programs, while other schools registration fees were different for each program. After setting up, we discovered the commonality of fees being waved because of financial aid, and other student programs.

### Bringing it together

We realized this project would need a lot of different pieces, and different faces depending on the user type. AD's needed to be able to manage program documents, payments and fees. According to the the regulations set by all the different conferences across the us, we needed a system that was functionally simmilar, and flexible to meet the needs of the school.
