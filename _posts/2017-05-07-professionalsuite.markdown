problem: "VNNâ€™s applications didn't support the demands of the staff running the schools programs. Especially when it came to scheduling, and event management."

**Interviews**

When we started interviewing VNN's partner athletic directors for some of our other products we heard the reoccurring theme of how big of a mess season scheduling was across school districts. I learned about all the other scheduling products out there that they had tried, but they only scratched the surface of their traditional system.
