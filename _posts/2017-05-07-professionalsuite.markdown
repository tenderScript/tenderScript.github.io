problem: "VNNâ€™s applications didn't support the demands of the staff running the schools programs. Especially when it came to scheduling, and event management."
solution: "Give Athletic Directors and their assistants a place that easily allowed them to create, manage, and share schedules with their conference before posting to the public eye."
