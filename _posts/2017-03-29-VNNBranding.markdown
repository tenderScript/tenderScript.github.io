**Company:** VNN

**Role:** Design

**Problem:** VNN’s lacked identity as a company, and the current site no longer met the needs of a growing company.

**Solution:** Create a new home for VNN for centralized contact with the community, and customers.



**Research**

Research and discovery was shared between design and product management. We started interviewing VNN’s partner athletic directors, and worked our way through their network of coaches, and parents.



**Company Discovery**

VNN originally started as a web service to local athletic communities in the midwest, but began to branch out as a product company



**Past Iterations**

The original product contained many features needed to solve our user’s problems, but suffered from long load times, unintuitive navigation, and lack of mobile support. Combination of these issues left many users getting lost, or only engaging with one piece of VNN’s suite of products.
