**Discovery**

Discovery research was split between design and product management. We started interviewing VNN’s partner athletic directors, and worked our way through their network of coaches, and parents.



**Customer Research**

We frequently heard from Athletic Directors about their difficulty communicating seasonal scheduling changes with their communities. Coaches and staff were also suffering from similar issues, as well as the inability to contribute their team’s content to the schools history.

**Evaluation**

The original product contained many features needed to solve our user’s problems, but suffered from long load times, unintuitive navigation, and lack of mobile support. Combination of these issues left many users getting lost, or only engaging with one piece of VNN’s suite of products.

**Suggested Sitemap & User-flows**

**Wireframes**

To address the usability issues, we built a prototype for testing that lead us to some incorrect solutions in our prototype. During user research we learned that some of our users only concern was a few teams per site.  Our initial plan was to add features allowing users to follow and filter content by team. Our usability tests showed users still preferred the existing products route to teams, however the real issue was that the team filtering happening in the wrong place.  Filtering was happening by ‘program’ when it needed to happen within the navigation, to a ‘team’ specific portion of the site.

**Design Guide**
To make sure the project remained consistent throughout our product iterations, I created visual design documentation for the theme styles to help both existing and future product team members as they build upon the product. These rules borrow heavily from more established design languages, like google’s material design and atomic design methodology.


**Atoms**
The most basic pieces of the site that contain no value on their own.

**Molecules**
Composed of atoms, but contain values that are lost without context.

**Organisms**
Composed of Atoms and Molecules, Organisms are blocks of content that make up a page.

**Capturing 1700+ Unique Brands**

Maintaining the integrity of the school’s branding, while using a single ruleset for the product turned out to be incredibly difficult. With the added requirements of accessiblity, our problem was that the schools all had such different color palettes to work with. The original product had the luxury of being built manualy as schools joined the network, however for Sports Hub there was the combination of the migration to the new platform, as well as adding new partners.



**Theme Logic**

I learned not every palette could use the exact same theme logic, but discovered that almost every school could fall into 1 of three basic types. During the setup (or migration) of the site Athletic DIrectors would select their school colors from here, we could ditermine what ruleset would best accompany the selections they made.

**Summary**

The release of the product sparked sales in regions the company hasnt been able to access before. Customer feedback lead to further discovery for accessability as well localization, and customization. The product remains to be activly developed as our customer base grew. Shortly after the first release of beta, we aggressivly planned feature sets for the 2.1 release to come before migration.
