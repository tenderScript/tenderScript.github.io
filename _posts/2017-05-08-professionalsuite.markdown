problem: "VNNâ€™s applications didn't support the demands of the staff running the schools programs. Especially when it came to scheduling, and event management."

The goal of professional suite's design was to stay true to the existing products, while enhancing the visual clarity of the UI. With VNN's products, we found that the existing visual direction was strong, but was under utilized. With only minor changes there could be massive improvements to the products functionality. Some
