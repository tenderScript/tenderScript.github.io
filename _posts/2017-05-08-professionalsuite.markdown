**Interviews**

While interviewing our partner athletic directors for some of our other products, we heard a reoccurring theme of how season scheduling between schools in the conference was a mess. Athletic directors would have to meet, share their schedules, and try to work out a schedule that would work for all of them. I learned about all the other scheduling products out there that they tried, but the programs only scratched the surface of their actual needs.

**Past Iterations**

After gaining a clear understanding of school's problems, we had to break down the needs of every sport and team event our system supported to meet their scheduling needs.

**Initial Wireframes & Sketches**

This project was first started behind the scenes while one of our <a href="/sports-hub/">other products</a> was in development. VNN's Professional suite was indented to be a supporting product that allowed easier creation of content. Our schools primary source of content revolved around vnn's event model, which were we started the first phases of planning

**Prototype**

The plan was to replace the old product's workflow with by editing events in the context they were being displayed. Not only had we seen staff attempt to do this during some previous prototype testing, it seemed to be a more intuitive approach than the existing product.

**Design**

Although portions of professional suite were to be done in context of the <a href="/sports-hub/">public facing product</a>, the design goals were to stay true to the existing products, while enhancing the visual clarity of the UI. The existing visual direction was strong, but it was being under utilized. With minor changes we believed we could make improvements to the products functionality.

**Iteration**

Professional suite was showing promise as an efficient event creation tool, however other pieces required to paint the full picture are in stages I cannot show. The state of this project may provide you with more questions than answers, but I felt it was important to include one of the first projects I participated in that made use of the full ux process. The motivations behind professional suite were to solve a common problem between all the schools, but additional phases of testing and iteration still need to be completed.
