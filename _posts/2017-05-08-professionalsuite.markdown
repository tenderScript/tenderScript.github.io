**Interviews**

While interviewing our partner athletic directors for some of our other products, we heard a reoccurring theme of how season scheduling between schools in the conference was a mess. Athletic directors would have to meet, share their schedules, and try to work out a schedule that would work for all of them. I learned about all the other scheduling products out there that they tried, but the programs only scratched the surface of their actual needs.

**Research**

After gaining a clear understanding of school's problems, we had to break down the needs of every sport and team event our system supported to meet their scheduling needs.
